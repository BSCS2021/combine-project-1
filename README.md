# Class First Joint Project - Web Development

Welcome to our class' first joint project! This repository is created to facilitate coordination among all the students in our class as we work together on a web development project. Each student will be responsible for their part of the project and can push their code to their forked repository.

## Project Description

Our project is a web development endeavor that includes tasks related to HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. We will be collaborating to build a comprehensive web application that showcases our skills and creativity.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account by clicking on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page.

2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:<br/>
    ```git clone https://github.com/BSCS2021/joint-project-1.git```

3. Set up the project in your development environment.

4. Before working on any tasks, create a new branch using the following naming convention:<br/>
      ```git checkout -b <branch_name>```

   Replace `<branch_name>` with a descriptive name that indicates the task you will be working on.

5. Start working on your part of the project and make regular commits to your branch.

6. Push your changes to your forked repository regularly using the following command:<br/>
            ```git push origin <branch_name>```

Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you created in the previous step.

7. When you have completed your part of the project, navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.

8. Click on the "New Pull Request" button to create a pull request.

9. In the pull request, set the base repository to `BSCS2021/joint-project-1` and the base branch to `main`. Set the compare repository to your forked repository and the compare branch to the branch you have been working on.

10. Provide a detailed description of the changes you made and any relevant information about your implementation.

11. Click on the "Create Pull Request" button to submit your pull request.

## Code Review and Merging

Your pull request will be reviewed by your peers. They will provide feedback and suggestions to ensure the quality of the code.

The project coordinator will then merge the approved pull requests into the main repository (`BSCS2021/joint-project-1`) to include your changes in the final project.

Let's work together, learn from each other, and create an amazing web project!

Happy coding!

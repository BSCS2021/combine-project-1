    <h2> Tips for Healthy Living</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eat a Balanced Diet:</strong> Incorporate a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats into your diet. Avoid processed foods and excessive sugar or salt intake.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Proper hydration supports digestion, circulation, and overall body function.</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise Regularly:</strong> Engage in physical activities you enjoy, such as walking, jogging, swimming, or yoga. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.</li>
        <li><strong>Get Adequate Sleep:</strong> Prioritize sleep and aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Sleep is crucial for body repair and mental rejuvenation.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain Mental Health:</strong> Practice stress-reducing techniques like meditation or deep breathing. Connect with friends and family, and seek professional help if needed.</li>
    </ul>

        Remember, healthy living is a journey, not a destination. Small, consistent changes can make a significant impact on your overall well-being. Listen to your body, be kind to yourself, and celebrate your progress along the way.
